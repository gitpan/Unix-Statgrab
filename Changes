    - 0.12 is now required for compilation
    - therefore: additional statistics for get_fs_stats()
    - fixed a minor nit in the POD tests:
      make sure that Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage are
      installed in the required minimum versions
      (thanks to Ricardo Signes <rjbs AT cpan DOT org>)

	  (Tim Bishop <tim AT bishnet DOT net>)
	- some DESTROY methods missing which potentially lead
	  to some slight memory leaks. Fixed.
	- added sg_get_process_stats(). I must have missed that one
	  for some reason.
